defmodule Mydia.Downloads.Structs.DownloadStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents the status of a download item (torrent or NZB) from a download client.

  This struct provides compile-time safety for download status data across all
  download clients (qBittorrent, Transmission, rTorrent, Blackhole, SABnzbd,
  NZBGet), replacing plain map access that can silently return nil.

  The struct is intentionally name-agnostic across torrent and Usenet downloads:
  every adapter normalises its client-specific state strings into the shared
  `t:state/0` taxonomy listed below.

  ## State taxonomy

  The `:state` field is one of:

    * `:downloading` — actively receiving data (includes torrent "stalledDL",
      NZB "Downloading"/"Fetching"/"Queued")
    * `:seeding` — torrent-only; post-completion upload phase
    * `:paused` — manually paused by the user
    * `:checking` — verifying/repairing/unpacking/moving. NZB post-processing
      ("Verifying"/"Repairing"/"Extracting"/"Moving") lands here so the
      DownloadMonitor doesn't prematurely flag the download as missing
    * `:queued` — waiting to start (reserved; some adapters fold this into
      `:downloading` to match client conventions)
    * `:error` — terminal failure
    * `:completed` — terminal success
    * `:unknown` — fallback for unrecognised values
